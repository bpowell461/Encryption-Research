# Encryption Research Project

##   Abstract 
  The purpose of this project was to develop three encryption algorithms and test each one in different categories. Under the guidance of Dr. Andy Digh, the algorithms selected were: **RSA**, **SHA-256**, and **RC4**. The source code was written for each algorithm with only utilities classes imported for use. Each algorithm was then tested and rated in three categories: *Efficiency*, *Security*, and *Complexity*. *Note: All source code is written in Java.*
  
##  Encryption Algorithms
Encryption Algorithms can be divided into three types: Asymmetric, Symmetric, and Hash Functions. 

 Asymmetric encryption, or public-key cryptography, uses a public and private key to encrypt and decrypt data. The keys used are numbers that are not identical to each other. As the name suggests, the public key is given to the public to encrypt data and the private is kept private to decrypt data.

 Symmetric encryption uses one private key to encrypt and decrypt data. The same key that is used to encrpyt data is also used to decrypt data. All keys in symmetric encryption are kept private.

 Hash Functions use no keys, instead they take a word or number and perform a hashing function in order to fix the data to an encrypted fixed size. The data in hash functions can not be decrypted, therefore hash functions are used to ensure that data has not been intercepted. 

### RSA
  The RSA algorithm, or Rivest–Shamir–Adleman  algorithm, was developed in 1977 and is one of the first asymmetric encryption algorithms used for cryptography. Although the algorithm is older, the RSA encryption algorithm still remains fairly secure. The RSA algorithm works as follows:
  * A user creates a public key based on two large prime numbers (n) and a common value of 65537 (e), the prime numbers are kept secret.
  * The public key is used to encrpyt a message 'm' with the equation `c = M^e (mod n)` where 'c' is the encrypted output.
  * The user uses the value of 'n' and the private exponent 'd' to create a private key.
  * The value of 'd' is generated by the equation `e^-1 (modulo λ(n))` where λ(n) is Carmichael's Totent.
  * The message 'c' is then decrpyted by the equation `c^d = m (mod n)`
